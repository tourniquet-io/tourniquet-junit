Tourniquet-Modules
================

Tourniquet has a modular structure so that it is more easy to use it in projects and does not 
add loads of dependencies into your project, that you don't need.

You may combine these modules, and some of the module have dependencies on each other. If you require all modules,
you may just add the _tourniquet-all_ dependency and you're all set.
